*** Installation ***

spinalDynamics uses CMake to support cross-platform building. 
In a UNIX-like system, the basic steps to build are:

1. Download and install CMake (if you don't have root privileges, just install to a local directory, like ~/bin)

2. Clone the repository 

With recursize : git clone --recursive https://gitlab.com/srill-fb99/spinaldynamics.git

Without : git clone https://gitlab.com/srill-fb99/spinaldynamics.git

If you did clone the repository without the --recursive option submodule you will need to fetch them.
This can be done as follow :

	git submodule init
	git submodule update
	git submodule foreach 'git submodule init'
	git submodule foreach 'git submodule update'

3. From the source directory, run:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..

and then the usual

	make 

Not that parallel compilation works, e.g. make -jN, where N corresponds to the number of core to be used

If you want to install it locally use 
 
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/.local/usr/ ../
   	make
	make install


4. To clean up, just remove the 'build' directory.



*** Use ***

1. Running tests

Tests can be found in the bin directory.
setting-manager and dynamics comes with a set of unit test. 
They can be launched with 

	cd build/bin

To launch the test related to the dynamics library simply run :

	./dynamicsTest # --help to see the different options

To launch the test related to the setting-manager library simply run :

	./setting-managerTest # --help to see the different options


2. Launching the opensim-modeller with a simple twitching controller

	cd build/bin
	./opensim-modelDemo ../models/10dof_18musc_config.yaml

The ../models/ folder contains 
- the different models (ending with .osim file)
- the config files (ending with .yaml file)
